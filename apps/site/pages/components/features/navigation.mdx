# Navigation

This feature enables customers to navigate among the store pages.

</header>

## Overview

This feature is intended to group the main store's page header components and from the components that are part of it, perform specific functions such as navigation among the store pages, navigation to the login flow and others.

---

## Usage

There is an available example of the usage of all the related components in the `<Navbar />` component on our [core](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/tree/main/packages/core/src/components/navigation/Navbar) application.

The recommendation is to use the components together, keeping the `Navbar` as the wrapper of the others.
