__experimental components exists while components are not migrated to FS UI. When that happens, their API might change

All overridable components are FastStore UI components. They are documented in the FastStore UI documentation. This makes it easy to override and leverage existing props by passing them down.

Prop overrides change the default definitions for that prop. Headless CMS props will always win override or default prop definitions.

An overridden component is nothing different than a regular custom component and should be used in the same way.

For each component, one must override only props or the whole component, never both.
