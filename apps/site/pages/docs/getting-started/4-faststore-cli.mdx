# FastStore CLI

</header>

The FastStore Command Line Interface (CLI) provides pre-configured scripts for initializing, building, and developing FastStore projects. It also helps to keep the FastStore projects up-to-date with the [`@faststore/core`](/docs/getting-started/3-project-structure#faststorecore) package.

---

## Runnig FastStore CLI on the project

The CLI is automatically added as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file, so once you run `yarn install` during the [setup of the project](/docs/getting-started/2-setting-up-the-project), you can start using it on the project.

## Installing FastStore CLI globally using `npm`

To use FastStore CLI commands globally on your machine, you can install the [`@faststore/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faststore/cli) using `npm`. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash copy
  npm install -g @faststore/cli
```

## Default commands

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
While using commands through `yarn` is sufficient for store development, 
[installing the FastStore CLI](/docs/getting-started/4-faststore-cli#installing-faststore-cli-globally-using-npm) is a prerequisite 
for [setting up your project with the Headless CMS](/docs/headless-cms-integration/2-setting-up-the-headless-cms#install-the-faststore-cli) and [creating new sections](/building-sections/creating-a-new-section).
