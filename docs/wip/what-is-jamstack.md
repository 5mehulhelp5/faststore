Objective:

Introduce the developer to the Jamstack architecture, giving an overview of its main aspects

This explanation doesn't need to be a long one. Instead, we must redirect the user to official resources.

## Jamstack Overview

> "A modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup" - Mathias Biilmann (CEO & Co-founder of Netlify).

Jamstack is an architecture which core principles [pre-rendering]() and [decoupling](), which enables sites to be delivered with better performance, confidence and resilience than ever before. 

### Why Jamstack for VTEX

<!-- > dar um gosto das vantagens  -->

There are two main aspects that are impacted positively in our platform as a result of using Jamstack architecture: performance and developer experience.

#### Performance

As eCommerce specialists we understand the impact of performance for our customers' success. Performance boosts a store's visibility with [better SEO scores](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/search-ads-speed), [raises customer satisfaction](https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/) and as far as [a 0.1-second imporvement of mobile site speed increases conversion rates by 8.4% for retail sites](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-ca/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-data/). 

Jamstack allows us to trade build time for performance. By pre-rendering the markup of our websites we are able to make them readly available with [Content Delivering Network's (CDN)]() avoiding unnecessary round trips to servers. And even though the content held by CDN's is static, it does not mean that the sites are static. In fact, with a process called [hydration]() all the power of client-side Javascript and API's is still available with the advantage that all the static content is immediatly ready.

#### Developer Experience
